        <h2>What is Recyclable Waste?</h2>
        <p>Recyclable waste refers to materials that can be processed and used again instead of being discarded. By recycling, we reduce the need for raw materials, conserve energy, and minimize environmental pollution. Common recyclable items include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper and Cardboard</li>
            <li>Glass Bottles and Jars</li>
            <li>Plastic Bottles and Containers</li>
            <li>Aluminum Cans</li>
            <li>Metals (e.g., steel, copper)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of Waste Segregation</h2>
        <p>Segregating waste into recyclable and non-recyclable materials is essential for efficient waste management and recycling. Proper segregation ensures that recyclable materials are not contaminated with waste that cannot be recycled, making the recycling process more efficient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Keeping recyclables clean and dry helps maintain the quality of the material for recycling.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Segregation prevents recyclable materials from being mixed with non-recyclables, which can make the recycling process costly and inefficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> Recycling saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and decreases landfill waste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Should Recyclables Be Segregated?</h2>
        <p>Effective segregation involves separating recyclable materials based on type. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paper:</strong> Separate newspapers, magazines, and cardboard. Ensure they are dry and free from food residue.</li>
            <li><strong>Plastic:</strong> Separate plastic bottles, containers, and packaging. Rinse them to remove any leftover liquids or food.</li>
            <li><strong>Glass:</strong> Separate glass bottles and jars. Make sure they are free from food residue, but do not mix different types of glass (e.g., window glass with beverage containers).</li>
            <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Separate aluminum cans and steel containers. Rinse them before disposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make sure to place non-recyclable materials like food waste, diapers, and hazardous items in separate bins to avoid contamination.</p>
